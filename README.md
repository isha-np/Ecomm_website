# Ecomm_website
This is a video about the e-commerce website whose frontend design I created.
All the images used are from Google images, and the details of products are purely fictional. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this website.

Unfortunately, I was not able to embed the video in the repository for a preview, so it must be downloaded to view it.
